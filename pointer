#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int *ptr1,*ptr2; //declarinig integer pointers as ptr1 and ptr2
    int x,y,temp; //declaring integer variables as x and y and also a temporary variable
    printf("enter numbers:");
    scanf("%d %d",&x,&y);
    ptr1=&x; //assigning address of x to ptr1
    ptr2=&y; //assigning address of y to ptr2
    temp=*ptr2; //temporary is assigning, with the value present in the address that was stored in ptr1
    *ptr2=*ptr1; //ptr2 value is replced with value present in the address that was stored in ptr1
    *ptr1=temp; //ptr1  value is replced with value present in the address that was stored in ptr1
    printf("x=%d y=%d",x,y);
}

output:

enter numbers:8 10
x=10 y=8

another programm by using call by reference

#include<stdio.h>
void swap(int*,int*); //prototype of a function with sunction name swap
int main()
{
    int a=10,b=20;//integer variables a,b has declared and initialized
    printf("before swapping:%d \t %d \n",a,b);
    swap(&a,&b);//calling a function by passing address nothing but call by reference
    printf("after swapping:%d \t %d",a,b);
}
void swap(int* x,int* y)//called function by integer parameters
{
    int temp;//declaration of a temporary integer variable
    temp=*x;//the value which has been refered by x will be stored in temp
    *x=*y;//the value which has been refered by y will be stored in x
    *y=temp;//the value which has been refered by temp will be stored in y
}

output:

before swapping:10       20
after swapping:20        10
